Description: This package provides the following approaches of
        multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on stress minimization by
        means of majorization (smacof): Simple smacof on symmetric
        dissimilarity matrices, smacof for rectangular matrices
        (unfolding models), smacof with constraints on the
        configuration, three-way smacof for individual differences
        (including constraints for idioscal, indscal, and identity),
        and spherical smacof (primal and dual algorithm). Each of these
        approaches is implemented in a metric and nonmetric manner
        including primary, secondary, and tertiary approaches for tie
        handling.
