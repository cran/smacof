Description: This package provides the following approaches of multidimensional
    scaling (MDS) based on stress minimization by means of majorization
    (smacof): Simple smacof (basic MDS) on symmetric dissimilarity matrices,
    smacof for rectangular matrices (unfolding models), smacof with constraints
    on the configuration, three-way smacof for individual differences
    (including constraints for idioscal, indscal, and identity), and spherical
    smacof (primal and dual algorithm). Each of these approaches is implemented
    in a metric and nonmetric manner including primary, secondary, and tertiary
    approaches for tie handling. Jackknife and permutation tests are included
    as well.
